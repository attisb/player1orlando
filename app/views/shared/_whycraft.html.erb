<h5>Why only craft beers?</h5>
<p>The number one reason is <strong>craft beer tastes better</strong> than the "beer water" that is mass produced and mass marketed by the big beer companies. Craft beer tastes better because craft brewers spend their time focusing the quality of their beer rather than focusing on their marketing campaigns and stock prices.</p>
<p>Oh yeah! Craft beers can pack a punch. Most craft beers range from 5-10% ABV, but some can reach 20%, 30%, and even 40% ABV.</p>
